# CapstoneJan2021
# Definition statement
For my capstone project I will be creating a Production Planning Website which will help businesses see the movement and pitch of their products along with production and ordering needs. 
# Elevator 
My name is Heather Ingargiola and I am currently a Bakery Manager for Schnucks and have worked there my entire professional career. Now I have decided to go through a transition and start a new career. I am currently in the Savvy Coders Boot Camp to learn how to be a Full Stack Developer. 
For my capstone project I will be creating a Production Planning Website which will help businesses see the movement and pitch of their products along with production and ordering needs. 
# Outline 
HomePage/ Title Page

 There will be four clickable links that will take you to the other pages.
 
Movement 

This page the user will be able to enter an upc or item number etc. They will then see the current movement on the item for every day for the last four weeks. At the end of each week it will show a total for the week.

Pitch

This page will work similar to the movement page except it will show what the user threw away. It will also calculate a pitch % so the user can easily see where that might have a problem. 

Production

This will be run once a week and will use that data from the movement and pitch pages to calculate how much of each product the user should be producing every day. The calculation will be simple, take what you have sold on that particular day the last four weeks and add them together, then divided by four. That will give you the average sales amount for that day. 

Ordering 

This page will take information from the production page and tell the user how many cases should be ordered to have enough product for production. It will also give what days things can be ordered, what times orders/ deliveries are, amount of items in case and a suggested order amount.
